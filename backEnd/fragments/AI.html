<p>You’ve probably heard versions of each of <span class="s1">the following ideas.</span></p> 

		<p>1. With computers becoming remarkably adept at driving, understanding speech, and other tasks, more jobs could soon be automated than society is prepared to handle.</p><div class="adunit ad--square-only ad--article-body display-none" data-adunit="__site/__square-rectangle" data-size-mapping="square-rectangle--mobile" data-active="true" style="display: none;" id="__site___square_rectangle-auto-gen-id-3"></div> 

		<p>2. Improvements in computers’ skills will stack up until machines are far smarter than people. This “superintelligence” will largely make human labor unnecessary. In fact, we’d better hope that machines don’t eliminate us altogether, either accidentally or on purpose.</p> 

		<p>This is tricky. Even though the first scenario is already under way, it won’t necessarily lead to the second one. That second idea, despite being an obsession of some very knowledgeable and thoughtful people, is based on huge assumptions. If anything, it’s a diversion from taking more responsibility for the effects of today’s level of automation and dealing with the concentration of power in the technology industry.</p> 

		<p><span class="s2">To really see what’s going on, we have to be clear on what has been achieved—and what remains far from solved—in artificial intelligence.</span></p> 

		<h3><strong>Common sense</strong></h3> 

		<p>The most stunning developments in computing over the past few years—cars that drive themselves, machines that accurately recognize images and speech, computers that beat the most brilliant human players of complex games like Go—<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608911/is-ai-riding-a-one-trick-pony/">stem from breakthroughs</a> in a particular branch of AI: adaptive machine learning. As the University of Toronto computer scientist Hector Levesque puts it in his book <em>Common Sense, the Turing Test, and the Quest for Real AI</em>, the idea behind adaptive machine learning is to “get a computer system to learn some intelligent behavior by training it on massive amounts of data.”</p>

		<p>It’s amazing that a machine can detect objects, translate between languages, and even write computer code after being fed examples of those behaviors, rather than having to be programmed in advance. It wasn’t really possible until about a decade ago, because previously there was not sufficient digital data for training purposes, and even if there had been, there wasn’t enough computer horsepower to crunch it all. After computers detect patterns in the data, algorithms in software lead them to draw inferences from these patterns and act on them. That is what’s happening in a car analyzing inputs from multiple sensors and in a machine processing every move in millions of games of Go.</p> 

		<p><span class="s3">Since machines can process superhuman amounts of data, you can see why they might drive more safely than people in most circumstances, and why they can vanquish Go champions. It’s also why computers are getting even better at things that are outright impossible for people, such as correlating your genome and dozens of other biological variables with the drugs likeliest to cure your cancer.</span></p> 

		<p><span class="s2">Even so, all this is a small part of what could reasonably be defined as real artificial intelligence. Patrick Winston, a professor of<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>AI and computer science at MIT, says it would be more helpful to describe the developments of the past few years as having occurred in “computational statistics” rather than in AI. One of the leading researchers in the field, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/540001/teaching-machines-to-understand-us/">Yann LeCun</a>, Facebook’s director of AI, <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/video/talks/cap/futureofwork/02_Open_Plenary.mp4">said</a> at a Future of Work conference at MIT in November that machines are far from having “the essence of intelligence.” That includes the ability to understand the physical world well enough to make predictions about basic aspects of it—to observe one thing and then use background knowledge to figure out what other things must also be true. Another way of saying this is that machines don’t have common sense.</span></p>

		<p><span class="s2">This isn’t just a semantic quibble. There’s a big difference between a machine that displays “intelligent behavior,” no matter how useful that behavior is, and one that is actually intelligent. Now, let’s grant that the definition of intelligence is murky. And as computers become more powerful, it’s tempting to move the goalposts farther away and redefine intelligence so that it remains something machines can’t yet be said to possess. </span></p> 

		<p><span class="s2">But even so, come on: the computer that wins at Go is analyzing data for patterns. It has no idea it’s playing Go as opposed to golf, or what would happen if more than half of a Go board was pushed beyond the edge of a table. When you ask Amazon’s Alexa to reserve you a table at a restaurant you name, its voice recognition system, made very accurate by machine learning, saves you the time of entering a request in Open Table’s reservation system. But Alexa doesn’t know what a restaurant is or what eating is. If you asked it to book you a table for two at 6 p.m. at the Mayo Clinic, it would try. </span></p> 

		<p><span class="s2">Is it possible to give machines the power to <em>think</em>, as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and other originators of AI intended 60 years ago? Doing that, Levesque explains, would require imbuing computers with common sense and the ability to flexibly make use of background knowledge about the world. Maybe it’s possible. But there’s no clear path to making it happen. That kind of work is separate enough from the machine-learning breakthroughs of recent years to go by a different name: GOFAI, short for “good old-fashioned artificial intelligence.”</span></p>
